        The first in line to claim the title of the city’s main attraction is the Tash-Rabat complex. It is a historical and cultural zone, which includes two of the oldest monuments: the Tash-Rabat caravanserai and the Koshoy-Korgon hillfort.

The Tash-Rabat caravanserai is one of the rare well-preserved monuments of the Middle Ages. It is located at an altitude of more than 3000 m above sea level in the picturesque gorge of Kara-Koyun, 60 km from the village of At-Bashi and 90 km from the city of Naryn. Tash-Rabat was built in the 15th century on the ancient trade route from Central Asia to China and served as an inn for merchants, ambassadors, travelers and other wandering. This is the largest building of Central Asian architecture of that era, built of stone. It is distinguished by not only its size, building material, but also a kind of layout, based on a clear symmetry. Lost among the pristine nature, far from populated areas, the caravanserai seems harsh, monumental and impregnable to onlookers.

Koshoy-Korgon hillfort is located 12 km from the village of At-Bashi. It represents the remnants of the fortress that existed in the 7th - 10th centuries on the caravan trade route in which the headquarters of the Turkic khans was located. Allegedly, it is named after Koshoy – chieftain hero and Manas’s ally. It was built to protect Kyrgyz land from Chinese armies. Once the hillfort whose ancient name was At-Bash had a square of more than 6 hectare – more than enough to host a whole army within its walls. The walls that now had sunk underground for more than half were 10 meters high and 7 meters wide. Almost all forts constructions are underground now. It has been proven the fortress was encircled with a moat and had 50 watchtowers. However, 30 years after it was constructed Mongolian invaders had demolished it. Hillfort had regained its role when Tamerlans army renovated it almost a century after tragic devastation. Afterward it served as a trailhead for Tamerlan’s eastern treks.
